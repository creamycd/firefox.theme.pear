# firefox.theme.pear
> The "Pear" theme of Mozilla Firefox

You need to [Restore the Menu bar in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/restore-menu-bar-firefox) to use this theme.

About how to change the theme? Well, maybe I'll write this later so please [Google](https://www.google.com/) it now...

This suits thee Windows Operation System.

If someone can help me review this thing, thank you so much.
